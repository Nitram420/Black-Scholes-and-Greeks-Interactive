The model helps estimate the theoretical price of European call and put options based on key market parameters such as volatility, time to maturity, and risk-free interest rate.


### Features:

Dynamic visualization of option price changes based on input parameters

Interactive widgets to adjust stock price, strike price, volatility, interest rate, and time to expiration

Graphical representation of option payoff and Black-Scholes pricing function

Jupyter Notebook format for easy experimentation and modification

### Requirements:

    matplotlib, numpy, scipy, ipywidgets
